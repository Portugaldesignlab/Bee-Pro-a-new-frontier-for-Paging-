🎯 Project Goal

To build a smart, generative paging system that creates a complete, multi-page layout ready for content insertion—text and images—without requiring manual setup on each page.

🔧 Core Objectives

🧠 One-Click Layout Generation: Enable users to generate an entire document's layout structure with a single action—automatically applying a clean, organized design across all pages.

📄 Placeholder Structure: Each page is automatically populated with editable layout zones—titles, subheaders, body text blocks, image frames, and captions—all proportionally aligned to grid and margin systems.

🎨 Design System Integration: Ensure visual consistency using pre-defined typography scales, spacing rules, and layout grids based on modern design principles.

🔄 Dynamic Layout Logic: Vary layouts page by page to maintain visual interest, but keep consistency through smart propagation of rules.

✍️ Content-Ready: Once generated, the layout acts as a framework—users only need to insert text and images in the placeholders. No additional layout editing needed.

📤 Export-Ready: Layouts should be ready for PDF export, web publication, or DTP tools like InDesign or Figma.
Example User Flow
